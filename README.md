# Networks-and-Communication
The course is an introduction to networking, protocols and communication.

We study how large international networks are constructed from the individual computers, via local area, city and national networks. We use the Internet as or working example of such a network. The aim of the course is to give insights into both the theory and practice of the area.

The focus of the course is on the protocols and algorithms used, and we will follow how they are used and implemented into the TCP/IP-stack - the basis of the Internet.

## Intended learning outcomes
The goals of the course is to teach the basics of networking and communication. For those interested in specializing in networking, it provides the fundamentals on which later courses build.

For those focusing on other areas of IT, it provides the basic knowledge needed to understand how networks and communication can be securely and effectively utilized in systems and applications.

After completing the course, students should be able to

1. Describe and explain the basic terminology used in networking and communication
2. Analyse communication scenarios and application requirements, and explain what methods and algorithms are suitable to use for a desired communication service
3. Explain, model and analyse the behaviour of networks using different methods for error control, flow control and congestion control, and predict how such a system will react in response to different events and conditions
4. Explain the functions of protocols of the different layers of the Internet model, and how different layers interact with each other
5. Explain and implement basic algorithms and mechanisms for error detection, error correction, flow control, congestion control and routing
6. Design, implement and analyse the behaviour of basic Internet applications and their protocols
7. Explain different functions and concepts concerning equipment for communication and networks
8. Compute and/or approximate the performance of communication systems, and suggest improvements.
